# Blockchain Network Monitor

A comprehensive real-time monitoring solution for blockchain networks with advanced analytics and visualization.

---

## Overview

**Blockchain Network Monitor** is a powerful, full-featured monitoring tool designed to provide real-time insights into blockchain network performance, health metrics, and system resource utilization.

The monitor continuously collects data from blockchain nodes, processes it into meaningful metrics, and presents it through a responsive web interface. This enables network operators and developers to quickly identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure network reliability.

> ‚ö° **Note:** This monitor was specifically built and optimized for a **private blockchain network** that I developed during my **internship at IIT Bhilai** as a **Blockchain Developer**.  
> Installation instructions for general public use are not included yet, as the system is fine-tuned for that private deployment.
